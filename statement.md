# Problem Statement
In most classes, teachers have to check a lot of students’ marks, and doing everything by hand becomes tiring and slow. When the marks are in a long list, it’s hard to quickly understand how the class is performing overall.
Finding the average, who scored the highest or lowest, or even seeing how many students passed or failed can take a lot of time if done manually.

This project tries to make that process easier. It reads the marks from a CSV file and automatically shows useful information like mean, median, mode, top students, and simple graphs. This helps teachers get a clear picture of how their students are doing without spending too much time on calculations.  
# Scope of the Project
This project helps its users to analyse the given data of students statistically and graphically. It saves the time of the teacher and education industries to analyse large data of the students. for using this program you have to save a CSV file in the same directory in which u have saved the program.
# Target Users
this program targets the teachers and researcher to study the progress of a class, a school, or even a district. this program can also be used by analysts to compare the progress of two groups of student
